> *"Data, data, data! I can't make bricks without clay."* — Sherlock Holmes
>
> In the chaotic world of prediction markets, information is everywhere, but **truth** is scarce. **Be Holmes** is an autonomous AI agent that acts as your private detective for financial events. It doesn't just read the news; it deduces the future.

## 🧐 The Case (What is this?)

**Be Holmes** is a next-generation market analysis engine designed to capture **Alpha** in global prediction markets (like Polymarket).

Unlike traditional bots that rely on simple sentiment analysis, Be Holmes uses **Second-order Causal Reasoning** to bridge the gap between unstructured breaking news and structured financial probabilities.

### The Detective's Toolkit (Core Features)

* **🔍 The Magnifying Glass (Real-time RAG):** Instantly retrieves and verifies cross-platform intelligence (News, Social Media, On-chain data) to gather "evidence."
* **🧠 The Mind Palace (Causal Inference Engine):** Powered by **Google Gemini 2.5**, it constructs a causal graph of events to simulate potential outcomes before they happen.
* **⚖️ The Verdict (Probability Calibration):** Converts abstract analysis into concrete trading probabilities (0-100%) to identify mispriced markets.
* **🗣️ Bilingual Interrogation:** Speaks your language. Inputs in English get English deductions; inputs in Chinese get Chinese insights. *(Coming Soon)*

## 🛠️ The Gadgets (Tech Stack)

* **Brain:** Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (via API)
* **Eyes:** Custom Web Scrapers & Polymarket Gamma API
* **Face:** Streamlit (Hosted on Community Cloud)
* **Nerve Center:** Python 3.10+
* **Disguise:** Cloudflare Custom Domain & Worker Proxy
